		Lorem Ipsum is <a href="ovning2.html">simply dummy text</a> of the printing and typesetting industry.
		<a href="http://www.dn.se/sport/fotboll/sverige-fick-oavgjort-i-osterrike/" target="_blank"> Lorem Ipsum</a> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
		1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
		make a type specimen book.

		It has survived not only <b><i>five</i> centuries</b>, but also the leap into electronic 
		typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
		1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
		and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
		including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

		<p>
		It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
		readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
		Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
		as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
		readable English.
		<br>
		Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors 
		now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem 
		ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
		 have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose 
		(injected humour and the like).
